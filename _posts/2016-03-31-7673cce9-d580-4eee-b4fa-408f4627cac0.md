A New, More-natural Approach To Atlantic Salmon Restoration

In 2014, we began to experiment with a cutting-edge process of implanting fertilized Atlantic salmon eggs directly into streambed gravel.

This method allows the salmon to incubate in their natural environment, and hatch according to the stream's hydrologic conditions and temperatures - as nature intends.

This approach optimizes the salmon's rearing so that, from the time that they are implanted as eggs, they're in perfect sync with their environment.  As they emerge from the streambed and first see the light of day, they feed naturally and learn very quickly to avoid predators - making them much more stream savvy than their hatchery reared counterparts.

First indications have shown that our initial effort has been highly successful.  We are optimistic that this more-natural approach will help Salmo _Salar_ to more firmly establish their population in the Saco River watershed.  It will also increase their odds of survival in their natal water, throughout the migrations and time spent in the north Atlantic and give them the heartiness necessary to endure the spawning run.
