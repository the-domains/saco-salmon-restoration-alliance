Based in Biddeford and Saco, Maine - the **Saco Salmon Restoration Allliance** is an Atlantic salmon restoration organization whose mission is to monitor, restore and maintain habitat while producing and enabling a self-sustaining run of wild, sea-run salmon in the Saco River watershed.  In the 34 years of our existence, we have maintained a salmon run on Maine's Saco River, but face various challenges due to environmental and ecological issues.

The Atlantic salmon is listed as an endangered species in Maine waters, and is in decline globally.  A great many issues, the presence of dams, degraded water quality, predation, over fishing and climate change threaten its future.
