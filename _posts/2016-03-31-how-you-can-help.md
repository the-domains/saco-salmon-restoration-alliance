**How You Can Help**

Due to the complexity of how the federal government has reshaped Atlantic salmon restoration programs since the economic downturn and sequester, we receive no federal or state funding to conduct our Atlantic salmon restoration efforts.                                                                                                       The DPS (Distinct Population Segment) Management Plan was reorganized as some restoration programs in southern and central New England were terminated.  All efforts in Maine's mid coast and Downeast Regions have been assumed into the Gulf Of Maine (G.O.M.) DPS zone, while the Long Island Sound DPS was completely eliminated with the Connecticut and Housatonic Rivers program closures.  With the closure of the Meerimack River program in New Hampshire, the Central New England DPS has also been virtually eliminated.  All resouces for the Gulf Of Maine DPS were frozen at the time of the sequester leaving our organization in restoration "no man's land".  This freezing of resources means that all funding, salmon eggs, juvenile salmon, etc. -- all assets if you will, must remain within the DPS zone.  Nothing can come into or leave from the zone.                                                                                                                       This development has been both a blessing and a curse.  The blessing is that because we exist outside of the G.O.M. DPS, we have a freedom as we are not under direct, strict adherence to federal control of our program (although we do work in collaboration with, and under the oversight of the Maine Department of Marine Resources).  The curse, is obviously the fact that we receive no funding or resources from the federally controlled G.O.M. DPS.   So at present, we work with the broodstock from the Merrimack River program, kept for us at the Nashua National Fish Hatchery in Nashua, NH as that too exists outside the G.O.M DPS.                      For the past 34 years, we've worked diligently to help the Saco River's salmon population to establish itself and maintain a run.  As a 100% volunteer, 501 (c)(3) non-profit organization, we continue to rely solely on our own fundraising efforts, membership dues, donations and various levels of sponsorship to continue our work.
